This [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension provides support for the [julia programming language](http://julialang.org/).

## Getting started

Once the extension is installed it needs to find the julia binary on your system. There are two options: if your julia binary is on the path and you have not configured something else, the extension will use that version of julia. Alternatively, you can set the ``julia.executablePath`` configuration setting to point to a julia binary, in which case the extension will always use that version of julia. To edit your configuration settings, execute the ``Preferences: Open User Settings`` command, and then make sure your user settings include the ``julia.executablePath`` setting.

### Windows

Though Windows uses backslashes for paths, provide the path to the Julia executable using forward slashes, such as:
```
"julia.executablePath": "C:/Program Files/Julia/Julia-0.5.2/bin/julia.exe"
```

### macOS

When setting your ``julia.executablePath``, you need to make sure that you are linking to the correct executable within your ``julia-x.x.app`` folder. The correct executable is located at
```
[Path to applications folder]/Julia-x.x.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia
```

## Development information

The file julia.tmLanguage for this extension was generated by running the [Yo Code - Extension Generator](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/tools/yocode) for VS Code with this [Julia.tmLanguage file](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Julia.tmbundle/blob/696f630736669251a3cb56cb27741b5b07a4c093/Syntaxes/Julia.tmLanguage) as input.
